The Jib Maven Plugin coupled with your CI/CD takes your containerization pipelines from "0 to 60" by removing the need for Docker and allowing you to plugin alternate build tools and declaratively define your container definition in the pom.xml. We'll compare Jib with Spring's build-image+Cloud Native Buildpacks and look at the use of Jib, Jib definition, and a sample pipeline with Trivy and SBOM tooling in GitLab.
