How can you build Java applications that remain secure, no matter the network conditions? Are you ready to move beyond traditional network-centric security models? This talk will unravel the core concepts of Zero Trust and present a novel approach to embedding this philosophy into your applications. Discover a technology that creates secure, private networks for your applications, effectively making the underlying infrastructure untrusted. Beyond Java, this approach extends its reach to other popular languages like Python, Go, C#, and more, making it a relevant session for anyone building connected applications and seeking to enhance their security posture, no matter their primary development tools. 

In addition to the Zero Trust subject, this session is a bit of a reboot, the first meeting after a bit of a hiatus.  We're looking forward to kicking things off as we return to a regular monthly cadence.
