This talk will discuss Zero Trust and one approach to embedding it into Java Applications. Zero Trust is about eliminating implicit trust and adding layers of security.  The technology that will be presented provides a secure and private network for applications, making underlying networks (local networks along with the public internet) untrusted. 

In addition to the Zero Trust subject, this session is a bit of a reboot, the first meeting after a bit of a hiatus.  We're looking forward to kicking things off as we return to a regular monthly cadence.
